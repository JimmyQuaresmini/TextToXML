This project creates XML-files from special text files.
The text-files describes people and each line
begins with P, T, A or F.
Person, Telephone, Address or Family.

To use it, run the file TextToXML.java with the 
textfile as a command line argument. The textfile
argument is required for the program to work. 
The textfile can have no ending or 
a file ending.

No output should be generated, but you should
see an xml-file with the same name as the 
textfile in the project's main directory.
